# MGE Oihguv Sucks

## What am I looking at
mge oihguv sucks is an MGE map that aims to create a fun playing environment. The new arenas serve to fill niches that the standard MGE map doesn't even come close to.

## What are these new arenas?
* 8\) is an arena heavily focused on movement. Falling in the lava will result in insta-death
(8 is a variant of 8)

* 8\) 2ez is a spire 2ez variant. It uses the turris ruleset from standard MGE. The lava is instakill.

* Amphi is a standard 20 point MGE arena. Falling in the lava deals 10dps.

* Counterjump [Granary] is an arena focused on air control. Falling in lava is insta-death.

* Counterjump Ringout is the same as Counterjump, except with effectively infinite health.

* Jump Castle is a purely fun arena. It's endif rules with a pushtrigger to keep players airborne.

* Height Advantage is an ammomod variant focused on air control. Falling off is insta-death.

* Spiremod is an ammomod variant for the spire fanatics.

* powowwV is Benroads' arena for MGE lords

* OG Ammomod is recreation of ammomod from am_variety_b2

## Building

At the time of commit, it's been a while since I've actually worked with Hammer. This is going off my best memory:

## Map Files
The main map file is included as mge_oihguv_sucks.vmf. This is the most up-to-date that I have worked on (A12). At least one other mapper has gone on with more work past this, which is not included in this repo as of writing.

### Older Versions
Two map files of older versions are included in this repo. mge_bouncy_castle.vmx is the original idea that sparked the map. This consists of the bouncy castle arena.

Oihguv_sucks is an early version which includes bouncy castle, along with a few arenas such as Counterjump

### Custom Textures
The credits room textures and skybox are the only custom textures used. These must be packed into the map with PakRat (or your preferred method) for distribution, unless you also want to distribute the textures.

The source files for the credit room textures can be found in texture-src. These are TGA files that are easily converted into the vtf format through VTFEdit, and the XCF source files that are opened with GIMP. Please add any credits necessary to these files if you are going to make changes.

The skybox textures are from the Quake 3 Skybox pack found here: https://lvlworld.com/review/id:2023

## Credits
If any map maker feels that I ripped content of theirs unfairly (or if I credited someone incorrectly), please PM me and we'll get it sorted out.

Encourage your team's server owner to switch out boring old MGE with this for maximum fun

### Notes

This is a github mirror of the source files for MGE Oihguv Sucks, since I did not want to have one of the only copies of it residing in my personal Dropbox. Feel free to edit it as you see fit, just give proper credit for any arenas you didn't create (similar to how I have in the credits image for the map).
